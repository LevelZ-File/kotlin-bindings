> Alternative Kotlin Bindings designed for Kotlin Multiplatform

## Why?

The official [java-bindings](https://github.com/LevelZ-File/java-bindings) are designed to be implemented on
the JVM. This project is designed to be implemented on Kotlin Multiplatform.

**They are intended to be functionally the same, and to not be used together.**
